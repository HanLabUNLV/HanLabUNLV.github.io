  bio         : "I am an assistant professor in the School of Life Sciences at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I obtained my Ph.D. in Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, studying genome evolution through gene duplication, loss and transposition with Dr. Matthew Hahn. Afterwards, I moved to Durham, NC to work on gene transposition at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent). I joined UNLV in 2013."

  bio         : "I work in the Han lab as a research assistant, where we are modeling the indel rates of unaligned segments of dna. I am interested in exploring new areas of genetics using computational methods to better our understanding of evolutionary processes on a smaller scale. I received Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics, Physics, and Philosophy from Texas Christian University in 2018 where I completed a thesis in computational biophysics about intracellular viral kinematics. In the future, I look forward to discovering new genetic patterns and phenomena in the Han lab."

  bio         : "I'm an undergraduate senior pursuing Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Currently, I am conducting bioinformatic research under Dr. Mira Han and I am interested in how to implement more efficient algorithms on applied programs. I will be receiving my bachelor's degree in May 2019 and will be pursuing a Computer Engineering and Science Master's degree shortly after."

  bio         : "I am a senior attending UNLV with a major in biological sciences with a concentration in cell and molecular and a minor in chemistry. I have been working in Han Lab since fall 2015 and am currently working on finding the correlation of mitochondria encoded genes with L1HS. I have done a SURF internship at Mayo Clinic Arizona. I hope to pursue an MD/PhD after graduation."
