  bio         : "I am an assistant professor in the School of Life Sciences at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I obtained my Ph.D. in Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, studying genome evolution through gene duplication, loss and transposition with Dr. Matthew Hahn. Afterwards, I moved to Durham, NC to work on gene transposition at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent). I joined UNLV in 2013."

  bio         : "I work in the Han lab as a research assistant, where we are modeling the indel rates of unaligned segments of dna. I am interested in exploring new areas of genetics using computational methods to better our understanding of evolutionary processes on a smaller scale. I received Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics, Physics, and Philosophy from Texas Christian University in 2018 where I completed a thesis in computational biophysics about intracellular viral kinematics. In the future, I look forward to discovering new genetic patterns and phenomena in the Han lab."
