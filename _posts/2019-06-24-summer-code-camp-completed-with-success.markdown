The first [summer code camp](http://mirahan.faculty.unlv.edu/summercode/) held from June 10th to Jun 21st finished with success. We had 15 middle school girls from Las Vegas sign up, and 13 completed the camp till the final day. Everyone in the lab participated as coaches and put in time and effort to run a smooth camp. The girls have created quite an impressive set of games, including a game that simulates natural selection. Take a look at the work they produced here: [2019 summer code camp studio](http://mirahan.faculty.unlv.edu/summercode/studio/)
