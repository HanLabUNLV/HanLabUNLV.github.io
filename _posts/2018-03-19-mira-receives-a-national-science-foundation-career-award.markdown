Mira received a National Science Foundation Career Award for her research project, “Using Indel Rate Variation to Understand Evolutionary Constraints on Distances Between Functional Elements in the Genome.” We will use the five-year award to study how insertion and deletion mutations impact the evolution of distances between functional elements, such as transcription factor binding sites in the genome.
